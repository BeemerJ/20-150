## ARCON Units

The remainder of what became left of the human race. Pre-Rupture humanity has been fully wiped out.
Designed initially to combat the forces of heaven, ARCON Units survived due to them being created half divine. Still mortal with the innate ability to evolve pass physicality once the humanity built in is fully phased out.
They are the last remnants of the existence of the human race, while also being the link to **Heaven** itself.

ARCON Units can be anything, raiders, traders, wanderers. When assumed control by **The Harbinger** they become a **Vessel**

## Heaven

The hivemind of what humanities metaphysical Apotheosis achieves. The concept and physical manifestation of the **Authors** will and carried out by the **Harbinger**.
The inevitability of humanity and the God of the universe. Always in a cycle of death and rebirth. Created as a concept to overcome and become simultaneously.
Upon realizing the inevitability of an end to **Heaven** and existence of the **Harbinger**, **Heaven** reaches a divine stasis. Only acting out of basic conditionals and defense (e.g. The Rupture).
Effectively inactive and with no motion and completely under control by **The Author**

## The Author

The creator of all. Not an active player in the world but the start of the world the **Harbinger** chooses their action in. The Author plants the seeds of what is possible and sets the options for the universe to exist in. Creates entropy in the perfection of **Heaven** by causing the **First Fallen** to reject Apotheosis.
Nothing outside of **The Harbinger** is physically capable of fathoming **The Author**

**The Harbinger**

You, the player.
The Harbinger is the controller of **The Vessel**, the only force of action above heaven. The one who decides the fate of humanity and the one to push **The Vessel** to achieve **Heaven** by killing the **Fallen** and reaching Apotheosis, and starting the cycle over again from the blueprint set by **The Author**.

## Fallen

The rejection of divine unity. Created by the Author to be the start of entropy. The fallen angels of heaven and the link to the divine between **The Author**.
The First Fallen returned to earth after rejecting **Heaven** to retain humanity however this was not a conscience choice as Heaven does not have one.

After returning to earth and starting the chain of events that start the birth of humanity, every living thing has that divine connection to the First Fallen and thus the force behind every living thing. A concept of life given physicality.

Before Heaven "humanity" destroys it and creates the universe in its own image. Resetting the dimensional continuum while still expressing creativity in its hivemind.

However due to the rejection of said system, the seed planted by **The Author** causes some of humanity to return to Earth, the exile of **Heaven**.

## The Vessel

The ARCON Unit **The Harbinger** assumes direct control of. Ends being a Vessel upon realization of **The Harbinger** or upon death. Effectively a constant. [[Death]] is not the end and reincarnates into another ARCON Unit by **The Harbinger**, however loses all past memories.
