ARCON Units are intended to survive as a link to the divine carrying the force of The First, a link to you, the player and reader.

There is entropy in Heaven. After the first angel returns to earth with their followers, heaven becomes stagnant and focused on a self induced static equilibrium.

The thing that makes ARCON Units different to pure humans while still being an extension of humanity itself is the connection to you, the spectator and the player behind everything. ARCON Units don't die, they just get reincarnated by the will of the player. The governing force behind everything, the true beginning and the end.

ARCON Units go beyond having a pre-written destiny of the inevitability of death. They are more both an extension of the player and the humanity earth left behind, being created with the full condensed soul of the First Fallen. If one ARCON Unit dies, it gets reincarnated into another, losing all memory outside of what you the player understands.
