# Combat System

## Overview
The game features a unique blend of classic roguelike and Wizardry-style combat, with special boss encounters at the end of each stage.

## Combat Phases
Combat is divided into three distinct stages, each with its own tactical considerations:

### Stage 1: Main Phase
- Initiative-based turn order
- Actions available:
  - Move forward/backward
  - Use items
  - Attempt to flee
  - Healing

### Stage 2: Target Selection
- Choose specific targets for attacks
- Consider positioning and range
- Time to target gets easier with the weapons class and the weapon itself

### Stage 3: Battle Phase
Enemy options:
- Advance forward
- Attack at range
- Attempt to flee

Combat actions are announced before resolution (e.g., "Spider advances forward, you prepare an attack")

## Combat Mechanics

### Weapon Systems
- Ranged Combat: Slider system (circular shape) with piercing mechanics for hitting enemies behind the primary target
- Melee Combat: Golf-like power system
- Item rarity system affects sell value

### Stealth and Perception
- Player's perception affects:
  - Random encounter distance
  - Chance of surprise attacks
  - Quality of loot (slight bonus)
- Enemy stealth system works as their version of perception
- Sneaking mechanics:
  - Option for surprise attacks (50% slower but increased crit chance)
  - Can attempt to move closer while remaining undetected

### Movement
- Final Fantasy-style movement with diagonal options
- Diagonal movement counts as 1 tile/roll
- Running mechanics:
  - Slightly lower chance of combat engagement
  - Increased chance of ambush
- Walking is default for higher chance of preemptive attacks

## Battle Statistics

### Hit Chance System
- D&D-style chance-to-hit mechanics
- Modified by various stats and conditions

### Weapon Properties
- Weapons:
  - Some require charging (1 turn)
  - Some need reloading each turn
- Quick reload and other perks available:
  - Agility increases chance to skip reload turn
  - Strength increases chance to skip recovery turns

### Special Combat Properties
- MTG-inspired combat perks:
  - First Strike
  - Double Strike
  - Life Leech
  - Disposable consumables may be bought for more properties

## Angel Encounters

Angels represent a unique and terrifying type of combat encounter that fundamentally alters the game's reality. These beings are actually humans from previous cycles who achieved godhood, manifesting as incomprehensible multi-dimensional entities, only fractionally seen by the players comprehension.

### Angel Properties
- Appear only at sync points (dimensional crossover locations)
- Manifest as abstract emotional concepts (terror, fear, lust, etc.)
- Visible only as fragments or impossible geometries (Multidimensional abstracts visible in 3D space to you and your senses)
- Cannot be conventionally observed or measured

### Combat Impact
When an Angel is defeated:
- The entire timeline is wiped and branches into a new path
- Player retains memories of the previous timeline
- World reconstructs itself in subtly different ways
- No physical trace of the Angel remains

### Encounter Mechanics
- Angels only appear in specific sync points
- Each encounter is unique and cannot be repeated in the same way
- Victory or defeat has cosmic implications for the game world
- For the most part, impossible to kill. Just survive as you are far too under developed.
- Angels are randomly generated with stats, visual representation, and comprehension in general.
