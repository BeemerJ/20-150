20-150 is a post apocalyptic top down RPG set in a distant future with a world drenched in past destruction. You play as a Prospector, just starting your journey off...

Your job is to get as rich as you can by infiltrating abandoned mineshafts, pre-war bases, caves, and anything that might have something of value.
If you manage to make it out of these locations alive, you head back to the closest town and sell what you don't need, until you die. 

Death is often **expected** in the world you live in, might as well go out doing what you love.

# The Cosmic Cycle

What appears as a simple post-apocalyptic world holds a deeper truth: you are an Xth Generation Human, part of an infinite cycle of rebirth and recreation. After winning an ancient war with cosmic forces, the previous humanity ascended and assumed the title to godhood, spreading across the interstellar universe. They left behind leftovers for a new human race, beginning an eternal cycle of ascension and rebirth.

## The Nature of Reality

- Each cycle represents a new branch of humanity growing, ascending, and seeding the next generation
- Death transcends conventional meaning in this multi-dimensional spectrum
- Humanity exists simultaneously as both god and worshipper, as the cosmic battle that incurs every few million years is fought with once thought humanity
- The human spirit's drive for growth persists across all cycles, until the humanity itself is redundant by godhood

## The Divine Connection

At certain points in space and time, "sync points" occur - moments where the dimensional barriers thin, allowing glimpses of greater truths. These rare occurrences might reveal fragments of past cycles, or hints of humanity's true nature.

Influences include Final Fantasy, The Binding of Isaac, Roguelikes in general and especially the world of Fallout.

You will lose your life, all that matters is how successfully you do so...
