20-150 is a post apocalyptic top down RPG set in a distant future with a world drenched in past destruction. You play as a Prospector, just starting your journey off...

Your job is to get as rich as you can by infiltrating abandoned mineshafts, pre-war bases, caves, and anything that might have something of value.
If you manage to make it out of these locations alive, you head back to the closest town and sell what you don't need, until you die. 

Death is often **expected** in the world you live in, might as well go out doing what you love.

# The Cosmic Cycle

What appears as a simple post-apocalyptic world holds a deeper truth: you are an Xth Generation Human, part of an infinite cycle of rebirth and recreation. After winning an ancient war with cosmic forces, the previous humanity ascended and assumed the title to godhood, spreading across the interstellar universe. They left behind leftovers for a new human race, beginning an eternal cycle of ascension and rebirth.

## The Nature of Reality

- Each cycle represents a new branch of humanity growing, ascending, and seeding the next generation
- Death transcends conventional meaning in this multi-dimensional spectrum
- Humanity exists simultaneously as both god and worshipper, as the cosmic battle that incurs every few million years is fought with once thought humanity
- The human spirit's drive for growth persists across all cycles, until the humanity itself is redundant by godhood

## The Divine Connection

At certain points in space and time, "sync points" occur - moments where the dimensional barriers thin, allowing glimpses of greater truths. These rare occurrences might reveal fragments of past cycles, or hints of humanity's true nature.

## The Parasite Threat

A unique organism, known as the Parasite, has driven humanity underground. Created by divine beings, the Parasite adapts to any condition but can only thrive in sunlight. This forced humanity into a literal dark age, as the surface became uninhabitable. Outside of full darkness, the Parasite can infect any living being, combining traits from different hosts and creating hybrid creatures. Its base form is microscopic, bonding with carbon dioxide and spreading rapidly after a host's death. Infection is only cured by full immersion in darkness for 8 hours; moonlight is not enough. The Parasite, once bonded with the host, feeds on organic matter. Its base form survives on carbon dioxide and sunlight, the host form may survive in hibernation while consuming sunlight when organic matter is scarce to keep the host alive.

## Human Conflict

Much of humanity's downfall was due to deliberate population control by other humans, not just the Parasite itself.

Influences include Final Fantasy, The Binding of Isaac, Roguelikes in general and especially the world of Fallout.

You will lose your life, all that matters is how successfully you do so...
