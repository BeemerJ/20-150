# Game Overview

## Core Concept
A proper top-down roguelike that innovates on traditional combat by implementing a Wizardry-style perspective for regular encounters, while maintaining special Soulslike elements for boss battles. The game focuses on single-player experience with multiple class options, including a necromancer class.

### Visual and Audio Design

### Difficulty and Progression
- Difficulty is location-based and chance-driven, inspired by Morrowind, New Vegas, and Diablo
- No enemy scaling with player level; areas have fixed threats and rewards
- Players can visit more obvious easier areas later on to feel tangible progression and increased power

### Item and Build System
- Hybrid progression: combines infinite item stacking (Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac) with structured gear slots (Final Fantasy, Monster Hunter)
- Stackable passive items grant buffs and debuffs, enabling emergent builds and class identities
- Items have both positive and negative properties, encouraging meaningful buildcrafting and tradeoffs

## Design Philosophy
The game aims to blend classic roguelike elements with modern gaming concepts from JRPGs, Rougelites, and others.
