20-150 is a post apocalyptic top down RPG set in a distant future with a world drenched in past destruction. You play as a Prospector, just starting your journey off...

Your job is to get as rich as you can by infiltrating abandoned mineshafts, pre-war bases, caves, and anything that might have something of value.
If you manage to make it out of these locations alive, you head back to the closest town and sell what you don't need, until you die. 

Death is often **expected** in the world you live in, might as well go out doing what you love.

Influences include Final Fantasy, The Binding of Isaac, Roguelikes in general and especially the world of Fallout.

You will lose your life, all that matters is how successfully you do so...
